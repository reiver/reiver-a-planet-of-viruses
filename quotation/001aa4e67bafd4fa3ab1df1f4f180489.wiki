<blockquote>
<p>
The very word ‘virus’ began as a contradiction.
We inherited from the Roman Empire, where it meant, at once, the venom of a snake or the semen of a man.
Creation and destruction in one word.
</p>
<p>
Over the centuries, ‘virus’ took on another meaning: it signified any contagious substance that could spread disease.

‘Virus’ only began to take on its modern meaning as the nineteenth century came to a close, thanks to an agricultural catastrophe [in the Netherlands on tobacco farms].
